# Vue.js front end API interface
**[Link to my live app.](https://3782291211.github.io/vue-api-interface/])**

In this Vue.js project, I have created an application that fetches and presents data from a Django/Python API that I have previously completed. This application allows users to fully interact with the API's endpoints and HTTP methods.

## Key product features:
- Data fetching using async/await
- Error handling
- Full range of CRUD operations
- Programmatic navigation with Vue Router
- Elegant styling with Bootstrap v5
- Meaningful UI updates with regards to loading and error states
